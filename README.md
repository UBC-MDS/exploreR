# exploreR

#### A Collaborative Software Development Project

February 2019

#### Overview

exploreR is an R package loaded with methods to help explore and explain the contents of a dataframe.

#### Functions

###### Function 1 | Variable summary
The function will take a pandas data frame as input and provide the total quantity of each type of variable present in the data frame. The output of the function will be a dataframe and will have one row for each variable type with its corresponding quantity. The function will look to identify 6 different types of variables: numerical, categorical, boolean, character, date, and an others category

###### Function 2 | Missing values per variable
For each column/variable in the dataframe, this function will count the number of missing values present and report back on that number per column. The function will accept a dataframe as input and output a corresponding dataframe with the above information detailing the counts of missing values per column/variable

###### Function3 | Dataset Size/Info
This function will take in a dataframe and print the shape and size of the dataframe. For the size, the function will print how much memory the dataframe consumes in Bytes or Megabytes. The function will also return information about the average size of each entry
